# UPES-OPEN
Welcome to the Github presence of the **UPES-OPEN** community.


## Who are we?
* We are a community of like-minded developers who are committed towards promotion and adaptation of **open source software**. Open source is made by people just like you. Learn how to contribute, launch a new project, and build a healthy community of contributors with us. ü§ù
* In February 1998, the open-source movement was adopted, formalized, and spearheaded by the [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative) (OSI), an organization formed to market software "as something more amenable to commercial business use" The OSI owns the trademark ["Open Source"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). The main tool they adopted for this was [The Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition). We as an organisation abide by standards set by the OSI.

## Why Open Source?
* The collaborative nature of the open-source community creates software that can offer customizability and, as a result, promotes the adoption of its products.
* The open-source community promotes the creation of software that is not proprietary, resulting in lower costs.
* Individuals who have intrinsic interest in code writing and software creation motivate the development of open-source software within the community. This differs from proprietary software, the development of which is often motivated through potential monetary gains.‚úåÔ∏è
* Open source provides flexibility not available in closed products. The hope is that individuals make improvements to an open tool and will offer those improvements to the original developer and community at large. The give-and-take of the gift economy benefits the entire community.
* Open-source licenses and software can be combined with proprietary software. While open source was initially seen as a threat to corporations, some companies found ways to strengthen their proprietary code with open-source code, re-releasing it as an improvement.
* Globalization of Market.
